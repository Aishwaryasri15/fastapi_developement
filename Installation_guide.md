### macOS – Python Setup

```bash
brew install python              # Install latest Python
python3 -m venv .venv            # Create a virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate        # Activate the virtual environment

This installs Python using Homebrew, creates an isolated virtual environment for the project, and activates it so dependencies are installed locally.
```
```
### Postman Installation

```bash
brew install --cask postman      # Install Postman using Homebrew
``` 
This command installs Postman, a popular API development tool, on macOS using Homebrew.
