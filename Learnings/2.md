Why do we need schemas in FastAPI applications?

1. Data validation: Schemas (Pydantic models) ensure the input data is correct in type and format before processing.
2. Clear API contract: They define what request and response data should look like, avoiding confusion between frontend and backend.
3. Automatic documentation: FastAPI uses schemas to generate Swagger/OpenAPI docs automatically.
4. Error handling: Invalid data is caught early with clear, readable error messages.
5. Security & consistency: Prevents unwanted or extra fields and keeps data consistent across the app.
